# Abstract
An Application for Efficient University Event Management
This abstract proposes the development of a mobile application designed to streamline the management and participation in university events. The application targets both students and event organizers, providing a user-friendly platform for event discovery, registration, and feedback.

# Key features:

- Students:

- Event organizers:
Add and manage events with ease.    Include detailed information like name, date, image, and description.    Promote events directly through the app.    Gain valuable insights from student feedback.

This application aims to enhance the overall event experience for both students and organizers, leading to increased participation, improved event planning, and a more vibrant campus community.
